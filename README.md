# Learning Week 2019: Kata

## Introduction

There is a collection of small challenges that should be easy to solve.
The goal of this code katas is 'not' to focus on the problem but to
improve a certain aspect of programming. Every day you start over from scratch
and you must not use any existing code. The easiest way is to check out 
a new branch from master each time. 

Examples:

* Use keyboard shortcuts
* Follow strictly TDD
* Improve in typing speed
* Do not use mouse

It is strongly recommended to choose one aspect and to train this aspect 
for some katas. Only then you will see an improvement.

## Some useful IntelliJ-Shortcuts

* `CMD + 4, CMD + R`: Open Test tab and run specs
* `CTRL + R`: Run specs even if Test tab is not open
* `CTRL + SHIFT + R`: Run specific spec on cursors position
* `CMD + SHIFT + T`: Toggle between test file and code file

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:renuo/learningweek-2019-kata.git
cd learningweek-2019-kata
bin/setup
```

## Run tests

```sh
rspec
```

## Challenges

### TDD

The following exercises are good for TDD

* Diamond (http://codingdojo.org/kata/Diamond/)
* Fir tree (https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/function-katas/tannenbaum/)
* Seven segment display (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d7091aa7bf8d0001200c133)

## Exercise

Select a topic (the topic should be easy enough that you can solve it in the time given (30') and 
not be too difficult so you can focus on another aspect. It's recommended to not switch this aspect during the 
week since you can profit the most by repeating the exercise several times. And it's also important to really
focus on one single aspect.

### Possible Topics to focus at

With the challenges you can improve for example at:

* properly do TDD
* use as much shortcuts as possible
* do not use mouse but only keyboard
* ...

Or if you want to do something different:

* Typing speed: improve your typing speed - https://typing.io
