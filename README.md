# Learning Week 2019: Kata

## Introduction

There is a collection of small challenges that should be easy to solve.
The goal of this code katas is 'not' to focus on the problem but to
improve a certain aspect of programming. Every day you start over from scratch
and you must not use any existing code. The easiest way is to check out 
a new branch from master each time. 

Examples:

* Use keyboard shortcuts
* Follow strictly TDD
* Improve in typing speed
* Do not use mouse

It is strongly recommended to choose one aspect and to train this aspect 
for some katas. Only then you will see an improvement.


## Some useful IntelliJ-Shortcuts

* `CMD + 4, CMD + R`: Open Test tab and run specs
* `CTRL + R`: Run specs even if Test tab is not open
* `CTRL + SHIFT + R`: Run specific spec on cursors position
* `CMD + SHIFT + T`: Toggle between test file and code file

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:renuo/learningweek-2019-kata.git
cd learningweek-2019-kata
bin/setup
```

## Run tests

```sh
rspec
```

## Challenges

### TDD

The following exercises are good for TDD

* Diamond (http://codingdojo.org/kata/Diamond/)
* Fir tree (https://ccd-school.de/coding-dojo/function-katas/tannenbaum/)
* Seven segment display (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5d7091aa7bf8d0001200c133)
